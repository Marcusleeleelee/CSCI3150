\*: To encourage tutorial participation, quiz or simple programming task will be conducted at the tutorials randomly. We will randomly pick 5 tutorials and perform this at the end of the tutorial. Each quiz/programming task is worth one mark. There will also be a midterm written quiz worth 5 marks; the date will be announced in a later time.
