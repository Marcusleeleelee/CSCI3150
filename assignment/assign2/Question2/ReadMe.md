1. The current code base contains a scheduler framework.  To compile, input in the terminal:
    -  make

    - Then you can run it: ./Scheduler




2. For Question2 in Assignment Two:
    - Revise scheduler-impl.c (that is the only file you need to modify/submit) to implement the MLFQ scheduler. You could write **some helper functions** in this file as well. 

    - Your program should be compiled by:
  make

  Submission: You only need to modify scheduler-impl.c in your github repo. Do not modify other files.

PS: Make sure there is no compilation errors in your code. Otherwise, you may lose all points for this question.
