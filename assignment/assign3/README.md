# Assignment_3

There are two parts for Assignment-3.

The first part is the mandatory part, which is required for you to complete. It involves two problems, one is the wrritten problem about address translation, another is the programming problem about implementing the swapping policies using singly linked list.

The second part is the bonus part. If you finish it, we would consider the marks to add in your final grade. It involves one written problem, using Bochs Emulator to know more about segmentation and paging in linux-0.11.

The problems are in Assignment3.pdf. In order to help you finish the bonus part, we provide you a hand-by-hand Emulator Setup Guidance (seen in Enviorment_Setup_Instructions.pdf). You could set up the enviroment and finish the bonus problem according to the Setup Guidance.
